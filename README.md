# TerminalMon
Pok√©mon-inspired Linux terminal experience. Gain XP by running shell commands and earn and use "attacks" (custom scripts). Unaffiliated with official Pokemon branding. All names are original and user created.

## Current Features
TerminalMon can be named and will gain xp when using commands. They can learn and forget moves but cannot use them yet. Use tmon help for a complete list of commands.

## Coming Soon
* daemon will start with the "tmon start" command
* move scripts will be fully functional
* the install script will be tested on a fresh machine to make sure that it works properly
* evolutions will come at levels 30, 60, and 90
Stay tuned for more polished versions!

## Setup
### Script
Only compatible with unix-based command lines.
Run "chmod +x install.sh" and then "./install.sh" (whether or not this works yet is untested)

### Manual
Follow actions in install.sh
